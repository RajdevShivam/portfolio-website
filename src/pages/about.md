Hey, I'm Shivam.

I work as a Quantitative Researcher at [True Beacon](https://truebeacon.com/). My job is figuring out which quantitative strategies to bet on and how much money to put into each—basically pattern recognition, probability, and learning to be wrong gracefully. I use both data and common sense (though the balance shifts depending on the day).

Before True Beacon, I built quantitative models and backtesting systems at Magma Ventures and JPMorgan Chase. I also spent some time in the MLOps world at TCG Digital, building machine learning pipelines with Python and Flask.

I studied Aerospace Engineering at IIT Kharagpur (B.Tech + M.Tech, 2021). These days I think more about markets than aerodynamics, but the problem-solving mindset carries over.

## What I Write About

This blog explores **markets, mathematics, and metaphysics**—ideas at the intersection of order and chaos.

I write about things I'm learning and projects I'm building. Some are half-baked, some are finished. Both make it here.

I also love chess. [Challenge me if you're up for a game](https://lichess.org/@/ShivamRajdev).
