Hey, I'm Shivam.

I work as a quantitative researcher at [True Beacon](https://truebeacon.com/). Most of my time goes into thinking about which quantitative strategies are worth backing and how capital should be allocated across them. The work is equal parts pattern recognition, probability, and learning to be wrong without panicking. Some days the answers come from data, other days from judgment, and usually from a mix of both.

Before this, I worked on quantitative models and backtesting systems at Magma Ventures and JPMorgan Chase. I've also spent time in the MLOps world at TCG Digital, building machine learning pipelines with Python and Flask. Those experiences shaped how I think about systems, incentives, and the gap between ideas that look good on paper and ones that survive contact with reality.

I studied Aerospace Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, finishing my B.Tech and M.Tech in 2021. I don't work on aerodynamics anymore, but the way of thinking stuck. Break complex problems down, understand the constraints, and be honest about uncertainty.

This blog is where I write through things I'm learning and building. I'm interested in markets, mathematics, and metaphysics, especially where structure meets randomness. Some posts are exploratory, some are more complete, and many sit in between. The point isn't to sound finished, but to think clearly and leave a trail I can return to.

Outside of work, I play chess. It's a clean way to stay sharp and a constant reminder that small mistakes add up. [Challenge me if you're up for a game](https://lichess.org/@/ShivamRajdev).
