Hey, I'm Shivam.

I write about quantitative finance, philosophy, and building things.

This blog is my space to explore ideas, share what I'm learning, and document my journey in finance and technology.

## What I write about

**Quantitative Finance** - Markets, trading strategies, and financial modeling

**Philosophy** - Ideas that shape how I think and make decisions

**Projects** - Things I'm building and lessons learned along the way

**Personal** - Reflections and experiences worth sharing

## About this site

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), uses [Notion](https://notion.so) as a CMS, and is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

The design philosophy is simple: natural ease through whitespace and typography. Content first, everything else second.
